What is Awesome New Tab Page?
-----------------------------
Awesome New Tab Page is my attempt at making a more awesome new tab page for [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

How is it more awesome?
-----------------------
It's more like a home screen on an Android phone or a Windows 8 start menu. By that I mean that instead of just icons and bookmarks, you can have some very dynamic widgets that are always ready to show something useful. From the weather to the news, your _awesome_ new tab page is what _you_ make it. Customize and expand it as you choose.

I have an idea, who do I tell?
------------------------------
Well, I'd appreciate it if you posted it here: [voice.newtabpage.org](https://voice.newtabpage.org)

However, you can also contact me directly through Google+: [h4r7.me](http://h4r7.me/)

How are widgets made?
---------------------
Until I can manage the time to write better documentation, please refer to this sample widget:
[Awesome New Tab Page Shell / Example Widget](https://github.com/michaelhart/NTP-Widget-Shell)

Widgets are packaged within Chrome extensions (either exclusively or bundled in a pre-existing extension) and are added to the widgets menu for users to add to their new tab page.

If you have any questions, please email me from here: [h4r7.me](http://h4r7.me/).

What license is this extension released under?
----------------------------------------------
__[GNU General Public License version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)__

Who can contribute?
-------------------
Everyone who is willing to agree to allow me to publish submitted code under the GPL v3 or future licenses. This ensures both of us (and anyone else) can use it so long as it always remains under the same license.

Do widgets need to be licensed under GPL v3+?
---------------------------------------------
I'm not a lawyer (and of course can not provide legal advice, so take this with a grain of salt), but I do not believe widgets _need_ to be as they are separate "programs" (packaged and installed separately). However, I do recommend that all widgets be GPL v3+ licensed. However, in simplest terms: __no__.

This is, of course, unless you include something GPL licensed in your code (jQuery here being excluded, as it is [dual licensed MIT and GPL](http://jquery.org/license/)).
